# coinsence-docker
A minimalist docker implementation

- Download the latest humhub release into the `/humhub` folder.
- For additional modules, you can put them inside the `/modules` folder
- To run the docker composer image, just type:
`docker-compose up --build`

=> This is just a minimalistic version, a more advanced version will be coming.
